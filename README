This is a simple python program that uses NYC public database and pandas to create a roadmap of NYC. The database is lacking tons of data and a complete map was not able to be generated, and therefore directions are quite minimal - this was just an attempt to see how far you can get with a public and free database.

Just open and run/edit nycdrive.py

The other files are other ideas/implementations that you should just ignore.
